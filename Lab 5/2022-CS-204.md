### Task 3

#### 1-> Write a shell script which takes a positive integer as an argument on the terminal and then checks if it is a palindrome or not. In order to find the reverse of this number it must be passed to function named reverse(), which computes the reverse and passes both, the number and its reverse to another function called palindromeCheck(). palindromeCheck() then compares the numbers and echoes if the number is a palindrome or not.
